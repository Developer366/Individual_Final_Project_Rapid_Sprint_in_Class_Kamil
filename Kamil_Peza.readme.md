hopefully i can finish everything
-I was able to download all the modules and get the basic code to work
-created a form and table for appointments
-added a menu button to go to the appointment form
-added what the project asked me to have in the form and the user can enter the attributes 
for the appointment
-I had trouble when i pressed the add button, it would not save to the databse 
and would get an error screen
